# Analysis Report: Org Pack DRG Root Graph Guard (#3384)

## Scope

Cross-artifact analysis of `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `tasks/WP01-org-pack-drg-root-graph-guard.md`,
`lanes.json`, `.kittify/charter/charter.md`, and the binding operator rulings
`reviews/spec.ruling.md` + `reviews/plan.ruling.md`, plus the full `reviews/` trail
(spec: 4 review rounds + operator ruling; plan: 2 review rounds + operator ruling; tasks: 2
review rounds, both resolved with no HALT).

Verdict was set explicitly per the mission brief's rule: the findings list below is empty, so
`verdict: ready`.

## Detection passes run

For each pass, the result is stated plainly rather than left implicit.

### 1. Duplication

FR-003's merge/dedup rule, IC-02's implementation description, and WP01's Objectives text
restate the same rule three times (spec → plan → WP). This is the expected spec-kitty
restatement pattern across phases (each artifact is self-contained for its own reader), not
uncontrolled drift — the three restatements were checked against each other word-for-word on
the load-bearing details (`merge_layers(root_graph, drg_graph)` positional order, `drg/`
authoritative on label conflict, dedup via `duplicate_edge_triples`) and agree exactly. No
duplication-driven drift found.

### 2. Ambiguity

None found. The three areas most prone to ambiguity in a mission like this were checked
specifically:
- **Merge direction on conflict** — spec.md, plan.md (IC-02), and WP01 (T005) all state
  identically: root graph is the `merge_layers` `built_in` positional argument, `drg/` is the
  `project` positional argument, so `drg/` wins on same-URN label conflicts. No contradiction.
- **What counts as "distinguishable failure"** — pinned concretely and consistently everywhere
  it appears: `result != "success"` plus a non-empty `error` field in `--json` mode. No vaguer
  restatement ("an error occurs") appears anywhere in the four documents.
- **Scope of `OrgDRGFragmentError` broadening** (root-level graph, not just `drg/` fragments) —
  this was the exact subject of the plan-phase HALT; `reviews/plan.ruling.md` resolved it
  explicitly and `plan.md`/`tasks.md`/`WP01` all now cite the ruling's defect-class rationale
  rather than the (narrower) User Story 3, consistent with the ruling's PLAN-FRESH2-004
  disposition. No residual ambiguity.

### 3. Underspecification

None found. WP01 is unusually concrete for a single-WP prompt: exact function signatures,
exact code snippets for `_load_org_layer`, `_dedup_org_layer_edges`, `OrgDRGFragmentError`,
exact primitive names to import (`duplicate_edge_triples`), and a named pitfall (identity- vs
value-based edge filtering, since `DRGEdge` has no custom `__eq__` and value-equality filtering
would drop both copies of a duplicate instead of one). Every one of the 9 subtasks names its
exact test function, fixture shape, assertion shape, and "reverted-code check" (what a
regression would look like). Verified this isn't just confident prose: the code snippets,
line-number citations, and primitive signatures were checked against the live source (see
Section 4) and are accurate.

### 4. Charter alignment

Checked against `.kittify/charter/charter.md`'s binding rules:
- **C-011 / ATDD-first** — WP01's T002/T004/T006 are each a RED commit strictly preceding its
  GREEN implementation commit (T003/T005/T007), matching the charter's binding red-green cycle.
- **C-007/C-002 `__all__` convention** — plan.md's dedicated Export Discipline table and WP01's
  T007 step 4 both correctly conclude all three new symbols (including the non-underscore-
  prefixed `OrgDRGFragmentError`) stay out of `__all__`, reasoned against the actual gate
  (`tests/architectural/test_no_dead_symbols.py` only scans `src/` callers). Verified
  `_drg_helpers.py`'s current `__all__` is exactly `["load_validated_graph"]` today, matching
  the "unchanged" claim.
- **Standing Order #2 (campsite cleaning)** — plan.md's Campsite-Clean Scope section states a
  concrete method (AST literal-repetition scan + complexity read) and a plain "no debt found"
  conclusion rather than inventing busywork. Consistent with the charter's own instruction to
  say so plainly when true.
- **Standing Order #3 (tracer files)** — all three tracer files (tooling-friction, approach,
  design-decisions) are seeded and non-trivial.
- **Standing Order #5 (non-vacuous gates)** — every test in WP01's Test Strategy is pinned to a
  positive membership/exact-count/dynamically-computed-floor assertion, never a bare
  "no exception raised"; the Vacuity-by-empty-set guard section states this explicitly and the
  per-subtask "Reverted-code check" rows back it up mechanically.
- **Terminology canon** — no `--feature`/`feature` surface is touched by the functional change.
  The one pre-existing "Feature specification" instance at `plan.md:4` is upstream
  canonical-template boilerplate (`plan-template.md:4`, byte-identical), already caught,
  diagnosed, and deliberately left as-is pending an upstream template fix — recorded as SK-11 in
  `tracer-tooling-friction.md` with full rationale for not hand-patching just this mission's
  copy. Not re-filed as a new finding here since it is already tracked with a stated reason, not
  overlooked.
- **NFR-002 / Testing Requirements** (scoped test run, not the full ~17,000-test suite) — Gate
  Set correctly scopes to `tests/charter/` + `tests/architectural/`, matching the charter's own
  "run only the affected test packages" rule.

### 5. Coverage gaps

None found. Cross-checked `tasks.md`'s Requirements Coverage Summary against `spec.md`'s FR/NFR/C
table: every FR-001..006, NFR-001..002, and C-001..005 maps to WP01, and each FR/SC in turn maps
to a specific, named test in WP01's Test Strategy table (9 tests total, matching T002's 3 +
T004's 2 + T006's 4). `issue-matrix.md` carries exactly the three issues `spec.md` itself cites
(#3384, #3385, #3284) — #3389 (cited only in `plan.md` and the spec ruling as an out-of-scope
follow-up, never in `spec.md` itself) is correctly absent per the issue-matrix's own
one-row-per-`spec.md`-reference rule.

### 6. Inconsistency

None found, including against the live codebase — this was checked directly rather than taken
on faith, since plan.md/WP01 make numerous concrete, falsifiable claims:
- `src/charter/_drg_helpers.py`'s current org-load line, `__all__`, and imports match plan.md's
  "Current code" quote verbatim.
- `src/charter/action_doctrine_bundle.py`'s `except DRGLoadError` block is at the cited location
  and behaves as described.
- `doctrine.drg.loader.has_graph_files`, `load_graph_or_dir`, `merge_layers` (parameter names
  `built_in`/`project`, additive-only semantics), and `doctrine.drg.validator.
  duplicate_edge_triples`/`DRGValidationError` all match their cited signatures and semantics
  exactly, including the "second-and-later occurrence" dedup detail WP01's T005 relies on.
- `merge_layers`'s edge-combination (`list(built_in.edges) + list(project.edges)`) preserves
  edge object identity rather than copying, which is exactly the precondition T005's `id(e)`-based
  (not value-equality-based) dedup filter needs to work correctly — checked because this is
  exactly the kind of subtle bug this defect class produces one level down.
- `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/charter/context.py`'s catch-all `except Exception` and
  `_emit_error`'s `{"result": "error", "success": False, "error": ...}` JSON shape match FR-004/
  IC-03's described CLI error surface exactly, confirming "zero code change needed in the CLI
  layer" is an accurate claim, not an assumption.
- `docs/guides/how-to/governance/create-an-org-doctrine-pack.md` documents exactly the `drg/`-
  only, no-root-graph layout spec.md's User Story 1 depends on.
- `tests/charter/`'s live test count (1,519 test functions across 141 files) matches plan.md's
  "~1,500 tests" Gate Set citation.
- `tasks/WP01-...md`'s line count is 728 lines (`wc -l`), matching the "728 lines" the "Why one
  WP" section in `tasks.md` cites against the canonical 700-line ceiling.
- `packs/built-in/missions/mission-steps/software-dev/tasks/prompt.md:208` carries the "MAXIMUM
  PROMPT SIZE: 700 lines per WP" text tasks.md cites.

No test file `tests/charter/test_org_root_graph_guard.py` exists yet on this branch (correct —
it is WP01's own `create_intent`, not yet implemented).

### 7. Terminology canon

Covered under Charter alignment above (SK-11 already tracked, not a new finding). No other
terminology-canon issue found in the four artifacts.

## Findings

**None.** Zero findings across all seven detection passes. This reflects the mission having
already been through 4 spec-phase review rounds + an operator ruling, 2 plan-phase review
rounds + an operator ruling, and 2 tasks-phase review rounds (all resolved) before reaching this
analyze step — the artifact set was independently re-verified here against the live codebase
rather than re-trusting the prior rounds' conclusions, and no discrepancy was found.

## Verdict

**ready** — findings list is empty, so per the mission brief's explicit rule
(`findings list empty -> verdict: ready`), the verdict is set to `ready`, not left unset.
