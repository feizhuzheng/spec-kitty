"""Canonical kind & artifact-ID vocabulary resolver (FR-027, R-009, R-011-D).

This module is the single seam through which charter-layer consumers route two
vocabularies that were previously re-declared across five+ modules with three
incompatible spellings (research R-009):

1. **Operator kind tokens** (hyphenated CLI surface, e.g. ``agent-profile``) →
   canonical :class:`~doctrine.artifact_kinds.ArtifactKind`. That mapping lives
   on the enum itself (:meth:`ArtifactKind.from_operator_token`); this module
   re-exports the related error type for charter callers.

2. **Artifact config-stem IDs ↔ DRG URN node IDs** (research R-011-D, the dual
   "config stem vs DRG ``id``" system). A config/file-stem ID such as
   ``001-architectural-integrity-standard`` resolves to the DRG URN node ID
   ``directive:DIRECTIVE_001`` (and back) by reading the artifact's existing
   ``id:`` field — the same field already read by
   :func:`charter.catalog._extract_artifact_id`.

Canonical charter kind universe
-------------------------------
The charter kind universe is the 8 artifact :class:`ArtifactKind` kinds **plus**
``mission-type`` (which is *not* an :class:`ArtifactKind` member and is handled
mission-tier; see FR-032 / WP04). ``template`` *is* an :class:`ArtifactKind`
member but is resolved specially (mission-tier, no glob) and has no config-stem
↔ URN entry. Consumers must route every kind string through
:meth:`ArtifactKind.from_operator_token` (CC-4) — no second kind enumeration may
be re-declared in a consumer.

Layering
--------
Charter layer: this module may import ``doctrine`` and ``kernel`` but never
``specify_cli``. Org/project roots are passed in **as data** (C-008); this module
does not resolve them.

This WP (WP01) delivers the resolver and its tests only. Consumer rewiring
(``pack_manager`` WP09, ``list`` WP16, ``context`` WP17) lives in later WPs.

    (relocation mission doctrine-built-in-seam-consolidation-01KYW3TX, WP02),

    pack uses today, matching the live loader's own non-recursive org glob

    contribute ``<root>/doctrine/<singular>`` for live ``.kittify/doctrine``
    overlays.

    The ``recursive`` flag mirrors :class:`doctrine.base.BaseDoctrineRepository`
    (the live loader backing ``DoctrineService``/DRG resolution), whose
    three-source pattern is *built-in rglob + org glob + project glob*: several
    built-in kinds (tactics, styleguides, toolguides) organize artifacts into
    category subdirectories under ``built-in/`` (e.g.
    ``tactics/built-in/testing/acceptance-test-first.tactic.yaml``), which a
    non-recursive scan would silently miss — the exact silent-drop failure

    adversarial squad, severity 3; operator-ruled "fix it properly" rather

    "for one org root" -- this widens it beyond that literal text, a
    deliberate, operator-authorized scope expansion to close the defect
    class rather than leave it as a documented limitation: the returned
    list is grouped as *every flat entry, in org-root order* followed by
    *every legacy entry, in org-root order* -- entries are **not**
    interleaved per root as they were before this fix. Previously, with

    entry from ``b`` in the returned list, so a same-config-stem collision
    straddling two different org packs -- one legacy-shaped, one
    flat-shaped -- was decided by ``org_roots`` order, not by flat-vs-legacy
    shape, contradicting the documented flat-wins invariant whenever the
    legacy-shaped root happened to be listed first.
    :func:`resolve_artifact_urn`'s first-match-wins semantics over this
    grouped list now make the flat-layout file win a same-config-stem
    collision regardless of which org root either file came from, or which
    order the roots were supplied in -- see
    ``TestOrgScanDirsHelper.test_multi_root_precedence_flat_wins_regardless_of_root_order``
