"""Shared DRG graph-load helpers for charter resolver and compiler.

Introduced in WP03 of the
``excise-doctrine-curation-and-inline-references-01KP54J6`` mission so that
``src/charter/resolver.py`` and ``src/charter/compiler.py`` no longer
duplicate the built-in+project merge/validate sequence.

Updated in WP03 of ``layered-doctrine-org-layer-01KRNPEE`` to add
``_resolve_org_root()`` and perform three-layer (built-in → org → project)
DRG merging in ``load_validated_graph()``.

Architectural note
------------------
``charter`` sits below ``specify_cli`` in the dependency hierarchy::

    kernel (root) <- doctrine <- charter <- specify_cli

``_resolve_org_root()`` therefore cannot import ``specify_cli`` directly.  The
charter-layer implementation always returns ``None`` (no-config fallback).
Callers in ``specify_cli`` that need config-aware org-root resolution should
resolve the path themselves and pass it explicitly as the *org_root* argument
to :func:`load_validated_graph`.

    Required semantics (pinned by the PR-FRESH-001 regression tests in
    ``tests/charter/test_org_root_graph_guard.py``):

    - If **any single source** contains the triple **two or more times**, it
      is a within-source authoring bug -- possibly alongside an unrelated
      single occurrence in the other source. Every occurrence of that triple
      is left alone, so it keeps reaching the final
      ``assert_valid``/``DRGValidationError`` exactly as it did before this
      mission. Collapsing it here would silently absorb a real defect
      (this was the FRESH-001 bug: classifying by comparison to the FIRST
      occurrence's source alone treated every later occurrence -- including
      a same-source duplicate -- as "cross-source" the moment it differed
      from that first source, so 1x root + 2x drg/ dropped BOTH drg/
      copies instead of leaving them for validation).
    - Only when each source has **at most one** occurrence AND the triple
      appears in **both** sources does it collapse to exactly one retained
      edge.

    *root_edges*/*drg_edges* are the edge lists of the two pre-merge source
    graphs. :func:`~doctrine.drg.loader.merge_layers` combines edges via
    plain list concatenation (no copying), so every edge object in *graph*
    is identity-preserved from one of these two lists -- used here only to
    classify which source a given edge came from, not to redefine what
    counts as a duplicate triple.

    Reuses the canonical :func:`duplicate_edge_triples` definition of
    "duplicate" (C-001) to find every triple with a 2nd+ occurrence; the
    per-source occurrence count is a provenance check layered on top of that
    result, not a redefinition of it.

    Filters by object identity (``id(e)``), not value/triple equality:
    ``DRGEdge`` has no custom ``__eq__``, so two identical-triple edges with
    unset ``when``/``reason``/``provenance`` are pydantic-value-equal to each
    other -- a value-equality filter would drop *both* copies, leaving zero
    retained edges instead of the required exactly one.
