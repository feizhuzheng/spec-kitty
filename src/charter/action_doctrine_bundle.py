"""Action-doctrine bundle resolution (WP06 T029, #2532).

Relocated verbatim from ``charter.context`` (single-owner, no-net-growth for
that file). Resolves DRG-backed action doctrine artifacts for a given
``(action, mission_type/feature_dir)`` pair into an :class:`_ActionDoctrineBundle`
— the payload both the bootstrap-text renderer and the ``--json`` entrypoint
consume.

Cycle note: ``_build_doctrine_service`` and ``_normalize_directive_id`` are
imported function-locally / from their sibling homes respectively; the
former stays routed through ``charter.context`` (the single test-patchable
seam every other builder-consuming module already uses — see
``context_renderers/compact_governance.py``'s cycle note for the
established precedent) rather than importing
``charter.doctrine_service_builder`` directly, so patching
``charter.context._build_doctrine_service`` continues to redirect every
caller, moved or not.
